# Arduino Project (3-DOF Arm)

This is the code used in making a robotic arm which is controlled by Processing3(IDE) - Arduino(IDE) interface.

### Materials Used

1. 4 Mini/Micro Servo Motors 
2. 1 Arduino Uno
3. Cardboard and straws
4. Jumper wires

### Steps To Use:
Before starting make sure you have the Arduino IDE and Processing3 IDE installed.

1) Open the .ino code on Arduino IDE
2) After opening the .ino file open the .pde file on Processing3 IDE
3) Make sure the correct port number is fed into the code before running it.

This is the only blurry image I have of the project. :sweat_smile:
